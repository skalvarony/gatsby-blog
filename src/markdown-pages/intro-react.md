## What is React?

React is a **leading JavaScript library** for building user interfaces. Originally developed at Facebook (now Meta) and open-sourced in 2013, it quickly rose to become one of the most popular ways to create **fast** and **scalable** web applications.

### Why Use React?

1. **Reusable Components**: Write self-contained pieces of UI that manage their own state. These components can be composed to build complex applications more efficiently.
2. **Virtual DOM**: React’s in-memory representation of the DOM allows **faster UI updates**, improving performance and user experience.
3. **Vibrant Ecosystem**: An extensive community and ecosystem provide libraries, tutorials, and tooling support—ranging from UI kits to advanced state management (e.g., Redux or React Query).

> "**The main idea behind React is the concept of components—small building blocks that you can reuse and compose to create complex UIs.**"

### Quick Code Example

```js
import React, { useState } from "react"

function HelloWorld() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("Hello, World!")

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{text}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setText("React is awesome!")}>Change Text</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default HelloWorld
```
