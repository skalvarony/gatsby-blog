## What is the Context API?

The **Context API** in React is a way to **share data globally** across multiple components without manually passing props at every level. It’s particularly useful for themes, localization, authentication data, and other state you’d otherwise need to thread throughout your component tree.

### Why Use Context?

1. **Prop Drilling Relief**: Instead of passing props down through many layers, your components can directly consume context values.
2. **Simplified Code**: Your code becomes cleaner and more maintainable, especially in large-scale apps.
3. **Composable**: React Context pairs well with Hooks like `useContext` and can be combined with other libraries (e.g., Redux, React Query) for more sophisticated state logic.

## Basic Setup

### Creating Context

```js
import React from "react"

const ThemeContext = React.createContext("light")
export default ThemeContext
```
